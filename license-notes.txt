What do the licenses mean? I'm a commercial (closed-source) game developer. Can I use this art?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It depends on the license(s) the art is released under. Technicallyall of the art on this site is legal for use in commercial projects -- however, some of the licenses require you to distribute the source code of your entire project for free, and allow others to distribute the source for free as well. Here is a quick overview of the licenses and what they mean for commercial, closed-source developers. Disclaimer: I AM NOT A LAWYER, AND THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE. THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE BASED ON MY CURRENT BEST UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAY THESE LICENSES WORK. COMPLIANCE WITH LICENSING REQUIREMENTS IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY, EVEN IF THIS INFORMATION IS INCORRECT.
